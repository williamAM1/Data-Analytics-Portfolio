1    How many unique indicators are there?

SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT(indicator))
FROM 
	afdbmarkettrends2015

Problem 1 is complete. I've answered the question, 
but let's answer some questions that may be implied. 
I will output the 31 indicators along with the indicator names. 
We will sort the list alphabetically by the indicatorname.

SELECT 
	DISTINCT(indicator), 
	indicatorname
FROM 
	afdbmarkettrends2015
ORDER BY 
	indicatorname





2    Is the number of unique indicators equal to the unique indicatorname field? If not explain the discrepancy.

SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT(indicator)) AS indicator_count,
	COUNT(DISTINCT(indicatorname)) AS indicator_name_count
FROM 
	afdbmarkettrends2015



3    Remove all commodities from this table and put them in a separate table.

CREATE TABLE afdbmarketcommodities2015 AS
	SELECT 
		* 
	FROM 
		afdbmarkettrends2015
	WHERE 
		unit IS NOT NULL;

SELECT 
	COUNT (*) AS newcommoditiescount 
FROM 
	afdbmarketcommodities2015;

DELETE FROM 
	afdbmarkettrends2015 
WHERE 
	unit IS NOT NULL;



4    From the remaining indicators, are there any gaps in reporting?

SELECT 
	indicatorname,
	date,
	previousday,
	CAST(date AS timestamp) - CAST(previousday AS timestamp)  AS timegap
FROM (
	SELECT 
		*,
		LAG(date) OVER(PARTITION BY (indicator) ORDER BY indicator, date) AS previousday
	FROM afdbmarkettrends2015
	ORDER BY 
		indicator, 
		date) 
	AS laggedtable
