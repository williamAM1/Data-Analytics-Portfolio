I will be exploring a dataset found on data.world that was originally found on The Humanitarian Data Exchange. 
This dataset contains numerous market indicators of importance to the African Development Bank, 
along with dates and values for different indicators.

From this data I chose to ask seven questions/tasks:

1    How many unique indicators are there?
2    Is the number of unique indicators equal to the unique indicatorname field? If not explain the discrepancy.
3    Remove all commodities from this table and put them in a separate table.
4    From the remaining indicators, are there any gaps in reporting?
5    Calculate the 'PercentChangeDaily' of indicators.
6    Calculate the 'AverageMonthly' value of different indicators.
7    What were the indicators that increased the most percentage OVERALL from the inception of this data.
